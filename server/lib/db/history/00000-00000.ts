// 00000-00000: Initial database structure

// * History file contains a snapshot of the database structure at a specific point in time.
// * History files are named with the following format:
// *   {id[0..5]}-{id[5..10]}.ts
// * For timestamp, Unix timestamp is recommended because it is timezone-agnostic by definition.
